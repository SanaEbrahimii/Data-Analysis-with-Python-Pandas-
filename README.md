# Exploratory Data Analysis using Python and Pandas

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project implemented in Python.  
The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and basic data visualization using real-world data.

##  Project Overview
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a structured dataset with the goal of:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data
- Handling missing values and duplicate entries
- Renaming and standardizing columns for improved readability
- Converting data types for numerical analysis
- Performing descriptive statistical analysis
- Visualizing key trends and distributions

This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to build and demonstrate computational data analysis skills, particularly in preparation for PhD-level research involving large datasets.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values using statistical imputation
- Removing duplicate records
- Feature engineering (deriving new variables)
- Type conversion for numerical analysis
- Descriptive statistics and aggregation
- Visualization of data distributions and summary statistics

##  Repository Structure
- exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing all data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps

##  Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:
- Comfort working with Python-based data analysis workflows
- Experience handling and analyzing structured datasets
- Ability to interpret and visualize data
- Motivation to develop computational skills alongside a strong scientific background

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Applying more advanced statistical analysis
- Extending the project to larger datasets
- Applying similar analysis pipelines to domain-specific data (e.g. biological datasets)
